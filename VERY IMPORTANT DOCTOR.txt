this is an external flutter app that makes Authentication before navigate to MainActivity
https://github.com/Momen0Waleed/Coffee-Auth-flutter.git

if you need to run both apps correctly, follow these sequence:-
1-install both Github Repo.s
2-setting up the emulator
3-run Android app and quit from the app
4-run Flutter app and quit from the app
5-now you can return to Android app without running it

Now you can follow the correct Two-Apps Flow

=============================================================

just for your knowledge you can run the Android app alone without any problems and it will navigate you as a Guest

*** but it is not good to run Flutter app alone as it may crashes ***
